# ML Deployment Project

This project is a deployment of a simple supervised learning model onto the AWS cloud.

The model is containerized using Docker and then hosted on the AWS ECS (Fargate) service.

The model is made available to an Excel file that includes a vba macro that makes an api call on the hosted model.

For now the project can be demonstrated only when the AWS service is turned on.
